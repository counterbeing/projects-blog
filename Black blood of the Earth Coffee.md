Trying to see if I can figure out how to create my own BBotE.

### General trajectory for the first batch

- Ratio should be about 1.5 cups of coffee grounds to 4 cups of water
- Keep the cold brew as cold as possible
- Extract in 3 passes
- Extract using a Buchner Funnel with some kind of vacuum
- Coffee ground on the finer side

## Variables to play with
- Coffee/Water ratio
- Time spent brewing
- Number of brew cycles
- Type of coffee
- The filter size
